**Project Title**: South Slope Brewing District Tour (Modified version of Real Time Bus Tracker assignment)

**Description**: This is a simple animation of a bar hop through breweries in the South Slope Brewing District of Asheville, NC.

**How to run**: Copy all files into a folder and load index.html in a browser.

**Roadmap of future improvements**: 
  1. Change breweryLocations and breweryNames to one multi-dimensional array
  2. Initial marker in center of district will auto-click to show the popup text, which doesn't show currently.
  3. Entire district will be highlighted to show the boundaries.
  4. Allow an option to display all brewery markers at once. 
  5. Allow for a user to click on each brewery marker and see the address.
  6. Show an image when a user clicks on a brewery marker.

**TODO: Add MIT License information when I figure out what that is...**
